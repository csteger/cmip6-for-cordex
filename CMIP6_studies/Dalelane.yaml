      The metric describes the ability of a model to represent the spatial dependencies within ocean circulation, atmospheric circulation and between ocean and atmospheric circulation in terms of seasonal SSTs and Z500 Data is converted to seasonal anomalies, detrended with season-reliant trend-EOFs. 
      Seasonal variances normalized. 
      Adjacency-matrix between all pairs of grid cell with Spearman's rank correlation. 
      Maximal domains in tos (z500) with average pairwise rank correlation>0.95(0.93)-
      quantile of all pairwise correlations are found. All pairwise links between domains 
      (area weighted average time series) calculated with Distance correlation in tos, 
      z500 and cross-links between tos and z500. Tested to level 0.05 with control of 
      False Discovery Rate=0.05. New adjacency matrices constructed based on domain links.
      Adjacency matrices compared to references with Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).      
      Exponential transform wrt. value 1 for all 3 variables (individual Network Quality 
      Score-NQS). Geometric mean of NQSs over variables (Multivariate Network Quality Score,
      MNQS). Average of MNQSs over references.
